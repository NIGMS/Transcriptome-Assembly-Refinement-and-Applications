    "This notebook will run `denovotranscript` Nextflow pipeline utilizing Google Batch. It is a bioinformatics pipeline for de novo transcriptome assembly of paired-end short reads from bulk RNA-seq. It takes a samplesheet and FASTQ files as input, perfoms quality control (QC), trimming, assembly, redundancy reduction, pseudoalignment, and quantification. It outputs a transcriptome assembly FASTA file, a transcript abundance TSV file, and a MultiQC report with assembly quality and read QC metrics.\n",

    "\n",
    "### FastQC\n",
    "> FastQC takes the raw read files and runs a swift analysis of the read data. The two key output files are `joined_R1_fastqc.html` and `joined_R2_fastqc.html` which provide a visual illustration of the read quality metrics. It is important to note that FastQC does not manipulate the data for further steps, it just outputs an analysis of the data quality.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Filter\n",
    "> FastP is a bioinformatics tool that preprocesses the raw read data. It trims poor-quality reads, removes adapter sequences, and corrects errors noticed within the reads. The `joined.fastp.html` provides an overview of the processing done on both read files.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Assemblies\n",
    "> TransPi uses five different assembly tools. All of the assembly `.fa` files are placed within the assemblies directory. For all of the assemblies except for Trinity, there are four `.fa` files: one for each of the *k*-mer length plus a compilation of all three. Trinity does not have the option to customize the *k*-mer size. Instead, it runs at a default `k=25`, therefore only having one assembly.\n",
    "\n",
    "### EviGene\n",
    "> At this point, we have a major overassembly of the transcriptome. We use a small piece of the EvidentialGene (EviGene) program known as tr2aacds which takes all of the assemblies and crunches them into a single, unified transcriptome. Within the evigene directory, there are two files: `joined.combined.fa` is all of the assemblies placed into the same file and`joined.combined.okay.fa` is the combined transcriptome after EviGene has reduced it down. In each header line, there is key information about the sequence.\n",
    ">> For example: `>SOAP.k17.C9429 58.0 evgclass=main,okay,match:SPADES.k43.NODE_313_length_1670_cov_12.047941_g161_i0,pct:100/100/.; aalen=392,75%,complete;`\n",
    ">>\n",
    ">> - This header indicates that this sequence was found in both the SOAP and SPADES assemblies.\n",
    ">> - The `eviclass=main` means that this sequence is the primary transcript, and there are alternates identified.\n",
    ">> - The `aalen=392` is the amino acid length of the sequence.\n",
    ">> - The `complete` means that it is a complete reading frame.\n",
    ">> - For more information on interpreting the headers from EviGene, reference the following [link](http://arthropods.eugenes.org/EvidentialGene/evigene/) in section 3.\n",
    "\n",
    "### BUSCO\n",
    "> BUSCO uses a database of known universal single-copy orthologs under a specific lineage (vertebrata in this case) and checks our assembled transcriptome for those sequences which it expects to find. BUSCO was run on both the TransPi assembly along with the assembly just done by Trinity. To visualize BUSCO's results, refer to the `short_summary.specific.vertebrata_odb10.joined.TransPi.bus4.txt` and `short_summary.specific.vertebrata_odb10.joined.Trinity.bus4.txt` files.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Mapping \n",
    "> One way to verify the quality of the assembly is to map the original input reads to the assembly (using an alignment program called bowtie2). There are two output files, one for the TransPi assembly and one for the Trinity exclusive assembly. These files are named `log_joined.combined.okay.fa.txt` and `log_joined.Trinity.fa.txt`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### rnaQUAST\n",
    "> rnaQUAST is another assembly assessment program. It provides statistics about the transcripts that have been produced. For a brief overview of the transcript statistics, refer to `joined_rnaQUAST.csv`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### TransDecoder \n",
    "> TransDecoder is a program that \"decodes\" the transcripts. First, it identifies open reading frames (ORFs). From there, it then will make predictions on what is likely to be coding regions. For statistics regarding TransDecoder, refer to the `joined_transdecoder.stats` file.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Trinotate\n",
    "> Trinotate uses the information regarding likely coding regions produced by TransDecoder to make predictions about potential protein function. It does this by cross-referencing the assembled transcripts to various databases such as pfam and hmmer. These annotations can be viewed in the `joined.trinotate_annotation_report.xls` file.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Report\n",
    "> Within `report` is one file: `TransPi_Report_joined.html`. This is an HTML file that combines the results throughout TransPi into a series of visual tables and figures.\n",
    ">> The sub-directories `stats` and `figures` are intermediary sub-directories that hold information to generate the report.\n",
    "\n",
    "### pipeline_info\n",
    "> One of the benefits of using Nexflow and a well-defined pipeline/workflow is that when the run is completed, we get a high-level summary of the execution timeline and resources. Two key files within this sub-directory are `transpi_timeline.html` and `transpi_report.html`. In the `transpi_timeline.html` file, you can see a graphic representation of the total execution time of the entire workflow, along with where in the process each of the programs was active. From this diagram, you can also infer the ***dependency*** ordering that is encoded into the TransPi workflow. For example, none of the assembly runs started until the process labeled **`normalize reads`** was complete because each of these is run on the normalized data, rather than the raw input. Similarly, **`evigene`**, the program that integrates and refines the output of all of the assembly runs doesn't start until all of the assembly processes are complete. Within the `transpi_report.html` file, you can get a view of the resources used and activities carried out by each process, including CPUs, RAM, input/output, container used, and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "### RUN-INFO.txt\n",
    "> `RUN-INFO.txt` provides the specific details of the run such as where the directories are and the versions of the various programs used."
