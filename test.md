This Jupyter notebook is an introductory module for a transcriptome assembly learning course.  Here's a breakdown of its prerequisites, API requirements, and cloud access needs:

**Prerequisites:**

* **Basic Biology Knowledge:**  A foundational understanding of DNA, RNA, transcription, and gene expression is assumed.  The notebook includes quizzes to assess this knowledge.
* **Python Programming:** While the notebook itself doesn't contain complex Python code, familiarity with Python syntax and the Jupyter Notebook environment is helpful.
* **Command Line Interface (CLI) Familiarity:** The notebook mentions using `pip` (a command-line package installer), indicating some CLI knowledge is beneficial, although not strictly required for completing the quizzes and reviewing the material.


**APIs:**

* **No APIs are directly used in this introductory notebook.**  The notebook *mentions* the Google Cloud Life Sciences API as a tool that will be used in later modules, but it's not utilized within this specific file.


**Cloud Platform Account Roles and Access:**

* **None required for this notebook.**  The Google Cloud Life Sciences API is mentioned for later modules, implying that access to a Google Cloud Platform account with appropriate permissions will be needed later, but this introductory notebook only requires local execution and doesn't necessitate any cloud interaction.


**Necessary Cloud Platform Access:**

* **None for this notebook.**  This notebook focuses on background information and introductory concepts. Cloud access would be required for later parts of the course, based on its reference to Google Cloud Life Sciences API, but not for this particular Jupyter notebook.

**Software Installations (mentioned in notebook):**

* `jupyterquiz==2.0.7` (for the quizzes)
* `jupytercards` (also for quizzes, though not used in this specific notebook)


In summary, this notebook is a self-contained introductory lesson.  While future modules will require cloud access and specific APIs, this particular file only requires basic biological knowledge, familiarity with Python and Jupyter, and installation of a couple of Python packages.
